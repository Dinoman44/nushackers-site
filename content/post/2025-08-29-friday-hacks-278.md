## 1) Rewriting Services in Rust @ TikTok

When a high-traffic payment service hit CPU limits, we took a surgical approach: rewrite only the CPU‑bound endpoints in Rust while keeping the rest in Go. This sharing walks through the decision process, correctness and performance testing (shadow mode + stress tests), rollout strategy, and the results. Practical lessons on when and how to apply Rust in polyglot systems.

### Speaker Profile 🎙️️

Wu Xiaoyun is a current NUS student who recently worked on high‑traffic backend services during his internship at TikTok. He writes about systems engineering, performance optimization, and tooling and enjoys sharing practical, data‑driven approaches to real production problems.
